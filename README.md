# Distributed Databases
This is my Repo for The Distributed Databases courses at the Universtiy of applied sciences Kiel.
This will contain all code/files.
This is a course by Ehlers so this will take loads of work.

I work with Anket Mehra on YugabyteDB. 
The Task is defined in DDIS_24_Project_work.
Timeline is as follows: 
* E1 in Week 17
* E2 in W 21
* E3 in W 22
* E4 in W 23
* E5 in W 24
* E6 in W 25
